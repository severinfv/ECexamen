Study project: **Leveraging Natural Language Processing for Sentiment Analysis and Geospatial Insights**

This notebook covers a step by step implementation of two ** Natural Language Processing ** supervised learning tasks - a regression problem (to explore the connections between the hotels customer reviews and the feedback score) and a multi-label classification problem (labeling reviews on issues that customers face). Work with hotels data offers the possibility to use geospatial data - location of hotels and districts borders.

For NLP tasks a Hugging Face ecosystem is used. It offers access to datasets, pretrained models and libraries that simplify work with transfer learning. Geopandas library for spatial and geometric operations and Folium library for visualisations are used for geospatial analysis.
